Navigation Menu: A header section that includes links to "Home," "About," and "Contact." The links are styled to appear as inline items with a hover effect.

About Section: This section contains a contact form where users can enter their Name, Email, Phone, and a Comment. The form is neatly styled with full-width input fields and a submit button.

Feedback Section: After users submit their details and comments, the feedback is displayed in a separate section. This section is scrollable to avoid content overflowing outside the container.

Responsive Design: You ensure the page adapts to different screen sizes. On smaller screens, elements such as the form and feedback section resize properly to maintain readability.

Footer: A sticky footer is added to the bottom of the page, containing copyright information and styled to remain fixed on the page.

The key focus is on making the webpage functional, clean, and responsive while ensuring that form submissions are properly displayed without breaking the layout.
